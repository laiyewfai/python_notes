# Machine Learning 

# Classification, Regression, Clustering 

# Supervised Learning - data labelled 

# usage - Classification, Regression 

# assignments - (super simple), CNN

# Unsupervised Leanring - data is not labelled.

# usage - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

# assignment - K means 

# Reinforcement Learning 

# reward the system if it is progressing 

# Data Flow for Model/Algorithm 

# Statistics - To learn Means and Statistics (the keys)

# Process

# 1. Given a data file, split the data file into training data sets, and test data sets 

# 2. Use the train data set, get the model, or "fit the model"

# 3. Get the deviations and means

# For unsupervised learning - to establish the relationship between two variables - use correlation matrix 

# K nearest neigbour - supervised learning

# when u dot product two matrix, u rotate the matrix 

# Weather Forecast uses Naive Bayes Model

# Finance uses Random Forest Model
